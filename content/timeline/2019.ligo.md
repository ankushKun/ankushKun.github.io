Replicated the physics behind LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) at home.

- **Build:** Used microscope slides, broken mirror shards, a cheap laser pointer, and a salvaged lens.
- **Result:** Successfully demonstrated light interference patterns, making the invisible properties of waves visible.
