I have always been a huge fan of Pokemon. I have played almost every game from GBC to HGSS, and recently played a few 3DS games when I got my hands on a 'new' 3DS in Thailand.

I also started collecting Pokemon cards last year and as of writing this, I have around 350-400 cards. I couldnt look at them just sitting tightly in a tin and a cardbox, so I bought a pack of penny sleeves and a good binder (without the O-rings) and put all the shiny sparkly holo cards with cool looking artwork at the front, following with reverse holows and other normal cards that I like, and yanked the rest of the bulk back into the tin :)

At this point I have a bunch of cool art cards, in English, Thai, Japanese, Korean and Chinese, which look soo cool and valuable. I then tried a bunch of apps that scan pokemon cards and tell you more about it, but they all had their limitations or were straightup paywalled, that too by a large margin (not even an amount that one just spends without thinking much), so I did what every engineer would do at that point
