**WAuth is a social login system that lets users access Arweave webapps using Google, X, GitHub, or Discord — abstracting away complex wallet management.**

It bridges the gap between Web2 usability and Web3 power, making decentralized apps accessible to everyone.

### 🌱 The Problem
- **Web3 onboarding is hard.** Users don't want to manage private keys or install browser extensions just to try an app.
- Developers lose potential users at the "Connect Wallet" screen due to friction.

### 🚀 The Solution
- **Social Login:** Users sign in with accounts they already have (Google, X, etc.).
- **Invisible Wallets:** WAuth generates and manages a non-custodial wallet in the background.
- **Seamless Integration:** Developers can add WAuth to their app with just a few lines of code.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Arweave** for permanent storage.
- **OIT** for decentralized authentication.
- **React/Next.js** SDK for easy frontend integration.
