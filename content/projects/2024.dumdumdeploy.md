### 🌱 Origin
- Initially built as **DumDumDeploy**, focused on simple, fast permaweb deployments  
- Designed to give developers a smooth experience similar to modern cloud platforms like Vercel

### 🚀 Evolution Into ArLink
- The platform grew beyond its MVP and was rebranded as **ArLink**  
- Became the primary deployment tool recommended across the Arweave ecosystem  
- The team behind ArLink went on to raise a **seed round at a $2.5M valuation**

### 🧩 My Role
- **Built the original DumDumDeploy platform** from the ground up  
- Helped shape the early architecture and developer experience that ArLink is now built on

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- Made deploying permaweb apps **simple, fast, and accessible**  
- Showed how web3 deployment tooling can match (or exceed) the UX of modern web platforms  
- Set the foundation for ArLink — now a core part of the Arweave ecosystem
