+++

A prototype CubeSat built from scratch.

- **Hardware:** Custom 3D printed frame designed to standard 1U specifications.
- **Comms:** Implemented CW (Continuous Wave) telemetry using a 433MHz RF transmitter & receiver pair.
- **Goal:** To understand satellite subsystems and telemetry encoding on a budget :p
