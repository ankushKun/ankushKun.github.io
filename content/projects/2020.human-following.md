An autonomous rover that follows you around.

- **Stack:** Python (OpenCV) running on a phone processing video feed, sending commands to an Arduino controlling the motors.
- **Mechanism:** Detects human presence using YOLO and sends steering commands via Bluetooth serial to the Arduino rover.
- **Story:** Built shortly after TinkerFest after a failed attempt. This one worked perfectly! 🤭
