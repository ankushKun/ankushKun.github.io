### What It Does

CommentKit provides a **ready-to-use comment system** that works on any website with **passwordless authentication**. Just embed it with two lines of code and you're done.

### Tech Stack

The entire system runs on **Cloudflare Workers** for the serverless backend API, uses **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) for the database, and features a **pure JS embeddable widget** and a dashboard for siteowners.

### Features

Integration is incredibly simple—just add a script tag and a div to your page. The system supports **magic link authentication** (no passwords needed), **nested comments**, and customizable **user profiles** with display names and avatars. Users can **edit and delete their own comments**, and the **responsive design** works beautifully on all screen sizes. Being **edge-native**, it delivers fast response times worldwide.

### Why It Matters

CommentKit eliminates the need for heavyweight solutions like Disqus while giving developers full control over their comment infrastructure. Built on modern, scalable edge technology, it's **open source** and self-hostable with no vendor lock-in. Best of all, it has zero tracking, fully respecting user privacy.

### Use Cases

Perfect for **static site generators** like Hugo, Jekyll, and Next.js, as well as personal blogs, portfolios, documentation sites, and any website needing a simple comment section.

Lightweight, fast, and built for the modern web.
