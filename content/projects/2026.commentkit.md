I've written a handful of blogs now, and wanted to add a comment section. My first thought was to use Disqus — I'd seen it everywhere. But the free tier has ads, and the paid plans felt like overkill for a personal blog.

I looked at alternatives like Commento, Giscus, etc etc, but none really fit what I wanted.

So I built my own: **CommentKit**.

## The Two-Line Integration

After you create and verify a site on commentkits dashboard, this is all it takes to add comments to your website:

```html
<!-- Include the CommentKit bundle -->
<script src="https://commentkit.ankush.one/bundle.js"></script>

<!-- Add a div where you want comments -->
<div data-commentkit></div>
```

That's it. No complex configuration, no API keys in your frontend code, no build steps. The widget automatically:
- Detects the current page URL
- Creates a page entry if it doesn't exist
- Loads existing comments
- Handles user authentication
- Supports nested replies


## Architecture Overview

CommentKit has two main parts: the **embeddable widget** that runs on your website, and a **backend API** that handles storage and authentication.

```text
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Your Website  │◄───►│  Cloudflare Workers  │◄───►│ D1 Database │
│   (bundle.js)   │     │      (API Layer)     │     │  (SQLite)   │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```


## Embeddable Widget

When you add `<script src="https://commentkit.ankush.one/bundle.js">` to your page, here's what happens:

1. The script finds all `<div data-commentkit>` elements
2. It creates a hidden iframe pointing to the CommentKit domain
3. The iframe handles authentication and loads comments
4. Comments are rendered in place of the div on the host website

The tricky part is authentication. The widget runs on *your* website (`myblog.com`), but auth tokens need to be stored on the *CommentKit* domain. Cookies don't work cross-domain, so I use an iframe with `postMessage` instead.

```text
Your Website (bundle.js)
    │
    ├── Creates hidden iframe → commentkit.ankush.one/widget
    │
    ├── Sends messages via postMessage:
    │     { action: 'loadComments', domain: 'myblog.com', pageId: '/post' }
    │
    └── Receives responses:
          { action: 'commentsLoaded', data: [...] }
```

The iframe acts as a secure bridge. All API calls happen inside the iframe, authenticating via HttpOnly cookies that are completely inaccessible to JavaScript — never exposed to the parent website or even the iframe itself.

The `bundle.js` is a single js file containing all the vanilla code needed to talk to the iframe and render comments.

The final bundle is around 70KB minified (12KB gzipped), self-contained with no external dependencies at runtime.


## Backend

The API runs on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) using [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/) as the backend framework.

Data is stored in [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) — SQLite at the edge. The schema has tables for sites, pages, users, comments, reactions, and sessions.

Authentication uses magic links via [Resend](https://resend.com/). When you log in, you enter your email, get a link, click it, and you're in. No passwords to store or leak.

Security is handled through multiple layers: HttpOnly cookies for sessions (so tokens can't be stolen via XSS), HMAC-signed CSRF tokens for all write operations, strict input sanitization that strips all HTML, and Content Security Policy headers that block inline scripts. Everything user-submitted is treated as plain text, not code


## Dashboard

Site owners get access to a clean, functional dashboard:

- **Overview Tab**: Quick stats, recent activity, and analytics charts
- **Sites Tab**: Manage multiple sites, view comments by page, moderate content
- **Settings Tab**: Account settings, display name, and profile management

The dashboard is built with React and styled with a modern, minimal aesthetic using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components.


## Why Cloudflare Workers?

I chose Cloudflare Workers for several reasons:

1. **Global edge deployment**: Your API is served from the nearest datacenter to each user
2. **No cold starts**: Workers are always warm and respond in milliseconds
3. **D1 integration**: SQLite database with global replication, no separate database service needed
4. **Generous free tier**: 100,000 requests/day for free
5. **Simple deployment**: `wrangler deploy` and you're live


## Now What?

CommentKit is actively maintained and I'm planning several improvements:

- [ ] **Email notifications** when someone replies to your comment
- [ ] **Markdown support** in comments
- [ ] **Spam detection**
- [ ] **Theming** for customizing the widget appearance
- [ ] **Webhooks** for integrating with other services
