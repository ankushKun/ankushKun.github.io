+++

**Bringing the familiar Express.js development experience to the Permaweb.**

`aoxpress` is a routing framework for AO that lowers the barrier to entry for Node.js developers, allowing them to build decentralized compute processes using syntax they already love.

### ⚡ Key Features
- **Express-like Syntax:** Use `app.get()`, `app.post()`, and middleware just like in Web2.
- **ao-fetch:** Built-in utility for simple, HTTP-like inter-process communication on AO.
- **Lightweight:** Designed specifically for the constraints and capabilities of the AO computer.

### 🎯 Why It Matters
- **Low Learning Curve:** Node.js developers can start building on AO immediately without learning Lua or complex message passing patterns.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Build handlers and routes in minutes.
