+++

A budget-friendly approach to 6DOF VR gaming on Android.

- **Concept:** A clone of the popular game *Beat Saber*, but playable on standard Android phones with Google Cardboard.
- **Tech:** utilized **AR markers** to track "controllers" (paper markers held in hand), enabling 6-degrees-of-freedom movement without expensive sensor setups.  
  Built with **Unity + C#**, Google Cardboard SDK & Vuforia AR SDK
- **Result:** A playable rhythm game costing nearly $0 in extra hardware (other than a good phone)

Somehow the game is still live on Amazon app store (as of 2025)
