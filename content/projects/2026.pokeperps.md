PokePerps lets you go long or short on Pokemon card prices with up to 50x leverage. Prices are scraped from TCGPlayer every 30 seconds and published on-chain via a keeper oracle. All trading is non-custodial -- positions, margin, and settlement are handled entirely by the on-chain program.

## How It Works

```text
TCGPlayer.com                    Solana Blockchain
(card prices)                    (settlement layer)
      |                                |
      | scrape every 30s               |
      v                                v
+----------+    publish prices    +--------------+
| Backend  | ------------------> |   On-Chain   |
| (Elysia) |                     |   Program    |
|          | <------------------ |              |
|          |    read state       | (positions)  |
+----+-----+                     +--------------+
     | REST + WebSocket                 ^
     v                                  | sign txs
+----------+                            |
| Frontend | ---------------------------+
| (React)  |   Phantom wallet
+----------+
```

The backend scrapes TCGPlayer marketplace data and publishes price updates on-chain. The Solana program (Rust + [Pinocchio](https://github.com/anza-xyz/pinocchio)) manages all trading logic -- opening/closing positions, margin calculations, liquidations, and settlement. The frontend connects via Phantom wallet for signing.

## AI Agent Integration

PokePerps ships an [MCP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pokeperps/mcp) so Claude and other AI agents can trade programmatically.

```bash
# Claude Code (read-only)
claude mcp add pokeperps -- npx -y @pokeperps/mcp

# With trade execution
claude mcp add pokeperps -e POKEPERPS_KEYPAIR=/path/to/keypair.json -- npx -y @pokeperps/mcp
```

There's also a [SKILL.md](https://pokeperps.fun/SKILL.md) and [llms.txt](https://pokeperps.fun/llms.txt) for agents that prefer fetching instructions directly.
