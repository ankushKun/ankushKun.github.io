Frustrated by the lack of free, powerful image editors on iOS, I built my own.

- **Motivation:** Moving from Android to iOS, I missed having granular control over my photos without subscriptions.
- **Result:** A fully functional editor with filters, advanced cropping, and color adjustments built over a single weekend.
