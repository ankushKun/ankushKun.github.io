summary = "The package manager for the AO computation network, enabling developers to install, publish, and share reusable AO packages."

+++

**APM is the package manager used in the AO computation network — similar to LuaRocks, but built as a web3-native system specifically for AO.**  
It allows developers to install, publish, and share reusable AO packages, enabling a modular ecosystem for building decentralized compute applications.

### 🌱 What APM Does
- Provides a **package registry** for the AO ecosystem  
- Allows developers to **install** packages directly into their AO processes  
- Enables publishing of reusable packages for the community  
- Inspired by tools like **LuaRocks**, but adapted for AO’s permanent, decentralized compute model

### ⚙️ Core Features
- **Install packages** with a simple CLI  
- **Publish new packages** to the decentralized APM registry  
- **Versioning and permanence** powered by Arweave storage  
- Works seamlessly across AO processes and tooling

### 📈 Impact
- Makes AO development modular and composable  
- Encourages open-source collaboration within the ecosystem  
- Reduces duplication by allowing developers to share common logic and utilities  
- **Now adopted as part of the core AO infrastructure**, powering package distribution across the network

### 🔌 Ecosystem Fit
APM integrates naturally with:
- **BetterIDEa** (IDE & dev suite)  
- **CLI tools** for AO deployment  

Together, these tools create a unified and efficient workflow for building on AO.
