**Subspace is a fully decentralized communication platform with a familiar, Discord-like experience — but permanent, censorship-resistant, and powered entirely by the AO network.**  
It shows how real, everyday apps can run without central servers.

### 🌱 What Subspace Is
- A **chat and community platform**, similar to Discord  
- Fully **decentralized** — no servers, no central control  
- **Censorship-resistant** and **permanent**, thanks to Arweave  
- Runs entirely on the **AO compute network**

### ⚙️ Key Features
- **Channels and communities** you can join, just like Discord  
- Messages are **permanent** and stored on Arweave  
- No company or admin can take it down  
- Built on a simple, message-based architecture powered by AO  

### 🔐 Why It Matters
- Gives people a communication app that **can’t be shut down**  
- Shows that large, real-time apps can run fully on-chain  
- Makes decentralized tech feel familiar and easy to use  

Together, these show what’s possible when you build real applications on the AO network.
